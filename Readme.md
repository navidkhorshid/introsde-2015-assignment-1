### 'build.xml', 'ivy.xml', 'people.xml', and 'people_data.xsd'

##Features and tasks
###Based on Lab 3
* Use xpath to implement methods like getWeight and getHeight (getWeight(personID) returns weight of a given person, the same for getHeight)
* Make a function that prints all people in the list with detail
* A function that accepts id as parameter and prints the HealthProfile of the person with that id
* A function which accepts a weight and an operator (=, > , <) as parameters and prints people that fulfill that condition (i.e., >80Kg, =75Kg, etc.).

###Based on Lab 4
* Write a java application that does the marshalling and un-marshalling using classes generated with JAXB XJC.
* Make your java application to convert also JSON

##How to run it
You simply need to type 'git clone https://github.com/navidkhorshid/introsde-2015-assignment-1.git' in terminal.
Then, change directory to 'introsde-2015-assignment-1' folder. Then run 'ant execute.evaluation'.
You will see the outputs of both lab3 and people in the console, and also two files 'people_type.xml' & 'people_type.json' will be added to the project folder as the result of running Marshallers.
